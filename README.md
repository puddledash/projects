# Projects
This repository contains various different datasets gathered from Kaggle, webscraped off an internet page, or other data sources that will be referenced in the individual notebooks. The analysis projects are performed in either R or Python. I am quite new to github, so I apologize for the formatting as I am still learning as I go along.

## Structure
Each analysis will contain a brief overview / abstract, the code of the work, as well as the data used for the data mining.
